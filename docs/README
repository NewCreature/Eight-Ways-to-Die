Eight Ways to Die
-----------------

Description
-----------

Eight Ways to Die is an arcade defense game inspired by an old Commodore 64 game
I used to play when I was little. The object of the game is to protect Earth
from the incoming threats for as long as possible.


Getting Started
---------------

After starting the game, you will be presented with the title screen. From here
you will see the menu. To activate a menu item, press the number associated with
that item, click the mouse on that item, or touch the screen on that item.


Playing the Game
----------------

The game controls with the numpad keys 1-9, with each number corresponding to a
particular shield. To activate the lower-left shield, for instance, you press
the 1 key.

Your goal is to block the incoming threats by activating the shields at the
appropriate times to survive as long as possible.
