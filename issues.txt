Version 1.2

	[X]Update icons. We need these sizes: 512, 256, 128, 96, 72, 64, 48, 36, 32,
	   24, 16. Don't forget, the icons need shadows. I will probably just make
	   the standard icon size and resize and save. PSPs vector stuff seems to
	   work okay with resizing the canvas.
	   
	[X]Add menu to title screen.
	
		[X]Since we will be using touch or keyboard, we should have screen
		   dividers to indicate the various touch positions. These positions
		   will be equivalent to the keyboard inputs, so we can number the
		   positions accordingly. Options should be attached to certain keys.
		   For instance, 1 will be game start. Touching the 1 section or
		   pressing 1 will start the game.
		   
	[X]Add privacy screen. This will either be displayed the first time the game
	   is run or there will be a menu option to bring it up.
	   
	[X]Create git repository.
	
	[ ]Rebalance difficulty. I think the speed of threats should be limited
	   based on the level. Later levels would generate more and faster threats.
	   The first level should be easy to beat.
	   
	   [ ]Introduce large threat at level 2. Only generate large every so often.
	      Later levels will generate more large threats.
