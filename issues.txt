Issues
------

[ ]Fix mouse menu navigation. Currently, you can't activate any menu items with
   the mouse.

[X]Fix icon set to comply with new T3F requirements.

[X]See about removing the logo animation and adding copyright info to the title
   screen.

   [X]Decided to leave the logo animation and just make it skippable. The game
      doesn't include assets we can use to properly display copyright info on
      the title screen.

[ ]Update changelog.
