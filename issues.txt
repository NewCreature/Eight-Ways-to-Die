Version 1.2

	[ ]Rebalance difficulty. I think the speed of threats should be limited
	   based on the level. Later levels would generate more and faster threats.
	   The first level should be easy to beat.
	   
	   [ ]Introduce large threat at level 2. Only generate large every so often.
	      Later levels will generate more large threats.
	
	[ ]Add multi-touch support. Store swipe data for each possible touch so user
	   can play with both hands on mobile.
	
	[ ]Add sound for when ship fires shot.
