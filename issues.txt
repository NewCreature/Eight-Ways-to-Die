Version 1.2

	[ ]Rebalance difficulty. I think the speed of threats should be limited
	   based on the level. Later levels would generate more and faster threats.
	   The first level should be easy to beat.
	   
	   [ ]Introduce large threat at level 2. Only generate large every so often.
	      Later levels will generate more large threats.

	[ ]I saw a ship appear in the wrong place. I think something is not being
	   initialized correctly when the ships are activated.
